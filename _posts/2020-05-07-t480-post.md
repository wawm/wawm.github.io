# T480 Battery issues

Recently i have accuired T480 lenovo and installed Centos7 on it.

I noticed that the battery management is not so good as per Windows 10 as the laptop has 10 battery and i only got around 4 hours of time using it.

Been searching around the net and found out that TLP can be used for battery management in Linux.

# Installing TLP

```sh
sudo yum install tlp tlp-rdw
```
Test by starting TLP
```sh
tlp start
```
Output
```sh
TLP started in AC mode
```
Soon i realised that TLP wasnt working as expected as the kernel module acpi_call was missing

After some digging, found out that the packages can be installed [here](https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call)

As for me below are how i did it

- Download or clone the github from mkottman
- Extract and edit acpi_call.c

```sh
#include <acpi/acpi.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
```
with
```sh
#include <linux/acpi.h>
#include <linux/uaccess.h>
```
- Compile(If you run into issues compiling make sure that you have kernel-devel packages)
```sh
make
sudo make install
```
- If you run into issues on “can’t identify certificate”. I did the fix as below;

- Create config file(for this example is configuration_state.config). Note that you will need to only change the values in O, CN and emailAddress.

```sh
[ req ]
default_bits = 4096
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
string_mask = utf8only
x509_extensions = myexts

[ req_distinguished_name ]
O = spinnaker
CN = spinnaker
emailAddress = wanazlan85@gmail.com

[ myexts ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage=digitalSignature
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid
```
- Create a new signing certificate
```sh
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -utf8 -sha256 -days 36500 -batch -config configuration_file.config -outform DER -out public_key.der -keyout private_key.priv
```
-  Load the key with MOKUTIL. When prompt with a password just enter any password you want

```sh
mokutil --import public_key.der
```
- Reboot the machine and it will prompt for MOKUTIL, choose Enroll Key, and Key0. It will ask for a password, enter the password you choose previously.
- Once rebooted , check if the key is already signed
```sh
keyctl list %:.system_keyring
```
Output should be something linked
```sh
[root@spinnaker ~]keyctl list %:.system_keyring | grep -i spinnaker
 68211213: --alswrv     0     0 asymmetric: spinnaker: 42XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[root@spinnaker ~]
```
- Sign the keys into the module(make sure that the .ko is created as mentioned above, using make install on previous step

```sh
perl /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 private_key.priv public_key.der acpi_call.ko
```
-  Install, load and verify the module
```sh
insmod acpi_call.ko && modprobe -v acpi_call && lsmod | grep -i acpi_call
```
